# Project Name: Image Generation From Text Using Stable Diffusion

## Summary:
This project demonstrates the use of the Stable Diffusion model for generating images from textual descriptions. It involves setting up the necessary environment, running the model, and displaying the generated images.

## Objectives:
- To set up the Stable Diffusion model environment.
- To generate images based on textual descriptions.
- To display the generated images.

## Scope:
The project covers the installation of required libraries, setting up the Stable Diffusion model, generating images from text, and displaying the results.
### Used Libraries:
- diffusers: A library for running diffusion models.
-  transformers: A library for state-of-the-art natural language processing.
- Pillow: A Python Imaging Library for image processing.
- accelerate: A library for optimizing model performance.
- scipy: A library for scientific and technical computing.
- safetensors: A library for handling secure and efficient tensor storage.

## Results:
Successfully generated images based on textual prompts using the Stable Diffusion model.

## Conclusion:
The project successfully demonstrates the capabilities of the Stable Diffusion model in generating high-quality images from textual descriptions.
